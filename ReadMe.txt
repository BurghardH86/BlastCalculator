The following program calculates peak overpressure values of a propagating blast wave with respect to its position in space.

The calculation kernel is based on the modified Kingery and Bulmash equation for blasts. 
For further information read: 

Jeon, DooJin, KiTae Kim, and SangEul Han. "Modified Equation of Shock Wave Parameters." Computation 5.3 (2017): 41.

To start the programm, just run the "program.cs" and enter all values.
